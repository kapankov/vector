# Vector implementation with STL-compatibility

Important! This vector implementation is not intended to replace `std::vector`, does not contain any improvements or optimizations, and is created for educational purposes only.

There are no guarantees for the use of this code anywhere.

This code, unlike the GNU and MS implementations, is more compact (in a single file) and easier to understand. The code uses the C++11 standard.

The code does not support inserting ranges via forward iterators. There is also no specialization for `std::vector<bool>`.
